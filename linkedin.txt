I've just completed a comprehensive project focused on sentiment analysis of Arabic companies' reviews acheving auc roc 94% and f1 score 90% on arabic text. This project involved analyzing a dataset containing 39k reviews across 12 companies

ðŸ§  Key Highlights:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed company reviews and ratings to extract meaningful insights.

Binary Classification: Dropped neutral reviews to focus on predicting negative vs. positive sentiments.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented and fine-tuned models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and more. Achieved AUC-ROC scores ranging from 0.92 to 0.94!

Deep Learning Models: Experimented with LSTM, CNN, and Feedforward Neural Networks using pre-trained FastText embeddings for Egyptian Arabic. The results were impressive, closely matching the performance of traditional machine learning models.

Real-time Sentiment Prediction: Built a Gradio app to demonstrate the model's real-time sentiment analysis capabilities.

ðŸ“Š Metrics & Evaluation:

Detailed model performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy) are available in the results file.

Comprehensive comparison between machine learning and deep learning approaches.
